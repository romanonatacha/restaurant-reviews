Project created as part of the Udacity Advanced Web Front-End Nanodegree.

## Project Instructions

In this project, a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application.

## Run the Application localy

Clone this repository

### Installing

Inside the project directory run npm install

npm install
```

### Run the application

* In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have:
```
python -V
```
If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
(or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)

For Python 3.x, you can use
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
